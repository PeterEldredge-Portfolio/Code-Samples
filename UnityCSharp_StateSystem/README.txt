This State System code uses the Event Manager, so make sure to check that out first.
It is meant to be a practical application of the Event Manager.
This code is used in both The Silence of Ember County Demo and The Poisoned Roots.

I would recommend looking at the scripts in this order:

1. StateManager
2. GlobalStateUpdater
3. LightingGlobalStateUpdater/PostProcessGlobalStateUpdater/ObjectGlobalStateUpdater
4. SceneStateLoader (Just a bonus)
